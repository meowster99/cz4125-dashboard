Henlo Folks,

I configured the flask app to run using the main.py file.

If the webview doesn't automatically open on the replit page, it should be visible at this link: https://cz4125-group-project.joellecenedra.repl.co/.

Thank you :~)


Instructions for code (to keep it as clean as possible):
1. Fill in your parts on the pages.
2. Styles/ defaults colors to be shared accross pages go into the styles.py folder.
3. Store datasets in the 'data' folder.
